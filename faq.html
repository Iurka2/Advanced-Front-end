        2. Urban-R.dk offers rental of electric bicycles for a fee.<br>

        Possibly. remaining rent is refunded to the customer.<br>
        Any subscriber may, with one day's notice at any time, terminate the rental period upon return the next business day. The rental period finally ends when an agreement has been made<br>
        about picking up the electric bike and it has been picked up by Urban-R.dk. Possibly. remaining rent is refunded to the tenant / customer's account.<br>
        All rental charges are made through Dinero with payment by Mobile-Pay, credit card or transfer to bank account.<br>
        If the tenant does not pay on time, Urban-R.dk has the right to pick up the electric bicycle without further ado. Tenant is obliged to provide address and desired pick-up time. If this does not happen, Urban-R.dk is entitled to simply invoice the full amount for a new bicycle to the customer.<br>
        Urban-R.dk can never be held responsible for safety deficiencies on their rented bicycles. It is the tenant's responsibility at all times to ensure that the electric bicycle is in<br>
        a safe and sound condition before the electric bike is used.<br>
        When subscribing, you as a customer pay DKK 749 for the first month before delivery of the electric bike. The subscription may well be terminated within the first 30 days, but in that case Urban-r.dk is not obliged to refund excess rent.<br>
        If you rent an electric bicycle for more than a month, a new invoice is sent and you as a customer undertake to pay DKK 749 for the following month and so on. If the subscription is terminated in the middle of the period after the first month, Urban-r.dk will refund excess rent (Corresponding to DKK 25 / day, the tenant does not have the bicycle during the payment period).<br>
